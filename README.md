# Coherence via Focusing for Symmetric Skew Monoidal Categories

The symmetric skew monoidal categories of Bourke and Lack
are a weakening of Mac Laneâ€™s symmetric monoidal categories where: (i)
the three structural laws of left and right unitality and associativity are
not required to be invertible, they are merely natural transformations
with a specific orientation; (ii) the structural law of symmetry is a nat-
ural isomorphism involving three objects rather than two. 

We study the structural proof theory of symmetric skew monoidal cate-
gories, progressing the project initiated by Uustalu et al. on deductive
systems for categories with skew structure. We discuss three equivalent
presentations of the free symmetric skew monoidal category on a set
of generating objects: a Hilbert-style categorical calculus; a cut-free se-
quent calculus; a focused subsystem of derivations, corresponding to a
sound and complete goal-directed proof search strategy for the cut-free
sequent calculus. Focusing defines an effective normalization procedure
for maps in the free symmetric skew monoidal category, as such solving
the coherence problem for symmetric skew monoidal categories.
